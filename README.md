# Directions

Afterwards you will select how many characters you would like to have as your password with a range of 8 to 128.

Next you will be prompted to ask if you would liked special characters to be added to you password.

Then you will be asked if you would like lowercase or uppercase characters.

From there will select the Generate Password button to generate your password.
